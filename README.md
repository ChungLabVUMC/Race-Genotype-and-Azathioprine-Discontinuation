# Race-Genotype-and-Azathioprine-Discontinuation

This study examines whether genotype predicts discontinuation of azathioprine attributed 
to hematopoetic toxicity; secondary outcomes include weight-adjusted last dose, 
last white blood cell count (WBC), last neutrophil count, and delta white blood cell count; 
the validation cohort assesses weight-adjusted dose by genotype

Primary Exposure: 
&nbsp; ackr = rs2814778-CC genotype
Primary Outcome: 
	dose_depend = discontinuation of azathioprine attributed to leukopenia, neutropenia, 
	pancytopenia, anemia, and/or thrombocytopenia
Secondary Outcomes: 
	last_wbc = final WBC (closest to last dose in -30 to +3 days); 
	last_neutro = final neutrophil count (closest to last dose in -30 to +3 days); 
	delta_wbc = change in WBC from initial dose to last dose; 
	last_ratio = final weight-adjusted dose during follow=up; 
	avgdi = 6-month average dose intensity relative to target dose [validation cohort]
