# Race-Genotype-and-Azathioprine-Discontinuation

This study examines whether genotype predicts discontinuation of azathioprine attributed 
to hematopoetic toxicity; secondary outcomes include weight-adjusted last dose, 
last white blood cell count (WBC), last neutrophil count, and delta white blood cell count; 
the validation cohort assesses weight-adjusted dose by genotype
